# Tube Tap Alignment Sleeve
Sleeve for tube tap to make alignment easier.
When connecting two steel tubes end-to-end,
you may want to tap the interiors of both tubes to connect them with a threaded shaft (headless bolt).
The interior of a 25mm tube with 1mm walls can be tapped with an M24 tap, for instance.
This is also useful when working with tube-based wire shelf systems, some of which have untapped ends.
While you can buy taps and tap wrenches,
it turns out that starting them in alignment with the axis of the tubes is difficult.
This sleeve slips over the shaft of the tap on one end,
then extends out past the tap teeth to surround the outside of the tube.
Holes in the sleeve release trapped air (if any) and also let you see what you are doing.
The sleeves should be 3D printed just loose enough that they can rotate around the
tube but tight enough to keep good alignment.
The conical shape is both for strength and to make 3D printing more stable (due to the larger base)
and to provide an extra alignment surface against the tap wrench.
